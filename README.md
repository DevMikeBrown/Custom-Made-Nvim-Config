# About
> This is a Neovim Configuration you Custom-made from complete scratch
### Notes:
| Note | Description |
|---|---|
| NVIM-LSP | Controlled and updated by Mason and it controls LuaSnip |
| LuaSnip | Optimized to reduce performace-intensity, Gotta be Careful |
| Bufferline | There's fr a lot of... Oddities with it but it performs fine |
| LuaLine | Been Meaning to Configure it but it oddly has a large and complex configuration menu |
| GPP.lua | The GCC/G++ compiler acted (exits nvim after compilation) funky so i used ChatGPT to fix it(cooked...) |
| Build.lua | All this does is execute the build.sh file thats in the parent folder of the Source folder you should be in. |
